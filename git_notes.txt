due to extreme unfamiliarity with using git and the porousness of memory, these are some basic notes 
to help me remember how to push and pull content to/from github

#initial local repository setup
make sure git config --global user.name and --global user.email are set with appropriate values. enclose values in quotes.
use the git init command in directory that the repo will be placed
git clone https://github.com/r-pluss/roboart      (may need to add .git to end of that, not sure, will confirm later)
set up remote with git remote add origin https://github.com/r-pluss/roboart.git
can always double-check with git remote -v


#copying local changes to github
for each new file or changed file: git add file_name
after all changes have been added: git commit -am 'the commit message'


#updating local repo from remote master
git pull (this seems suspiciously simple, I think I may be missing something)
